    <p>To name a few of my past works</p>
    <p><strong>Turf Wars 2D Multiplayer</strong>: A 2D multiplayer PvP arena inspired by the single-player flash game RAZE by Addison Rodomista and Justin Goncalves. Featuring Raze-like mechanics in a 2D platformer map, the game enables real-time multiplayer shooting combat using Photon PUN networking on the Unity4 engine. Players can join existing rooms or create new ones, engaging in fast-paced, tactical shooter battles across multiple maps. Published on Kongregate.com under a contract, the game draws its name from the multiplayer mechanics of GTA San Andreas Multi Theft Auto client's servers, where players gangs fought for control of Las Venturas territories/turf.</p>
    <p>Check out the game on Kongregate: <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/Gunsling3r/gunslingers" target="_blank">Turf Wars 2D Multiplayer</a></p>
    <p><strong>Flappy Rajinikanth</strong>: My first published game in 2013. Inspired by the viral success of Flappy Bird that year, this 2D side-scroller pays tribute to South Indian superstar Rajinikanth, the Chuck Norris of India. Developed through unity3d YouTube tutorials, the game humorously features Rajinikanth racing a jumbo jet in an auto rickshaw over the Mumbai skyline. With simple yet addictive gameplay, it merges the iconic style of Rajinikanth with the charm of Flappy Bird. The game was also published on Facebook.com</p>

<p><strong>Roblox Content Creator</strong>: I began exploring non-Flash-based game development on Roblox platform in 2007 and since then created popular game content on the platform such as, Turing Test, Stone Wheel Life, The NASA Simulator, Interior Design Competition and 2017 Airport Tycoon, earning over a few 100,000 robuxs in Roblox.</p>

<p><strong>Core Engine (Manticore)</strong>: Joined Core Engine in 2021 and won Core game jams four times in a row, got awarded considerable amount of money. Joined Global Game Jam Core Diversifier in 2021 and was fortunate enough to grab 3rd spot worldwide, got awarded $1000 USD. A few of my Core Engine works. Ground Zero: The Encounter (PvP): This is a third-person PvP and PvE zombie survival MMO on Core Games. Players can explore a vast map, gather supplies, and fight to gain control of hidden bases, which enhance their resource generation. The Mystery of Taj: A speed-running game where players compete to solve puzzles and complete their speedruns. This entry for the game jam was based on the theme of Famous Landmarks. I created a game around Taj Mahal, which I bulit using kit-bashing with core provided 3D models. Ground Zero: The Beginning: This top-down game, inspired by Resident Evil and Silent Hill's "fixed-camera-system" and focuses on PvP and PvE within an MMO environment. Players compete for resources in a war-torn, zombie-infested city level, with the main objective being to complete quests to disable a ticking nuclear bomb. Lost in the Dungeon: A single-player 2D side-scrolling infinite dungeon crawler where levers are scattered throughout the map. These levers must be triggered in a specific order to open the treasure room located to the left of the spawn point, giving players a clear objective. As players explore the dungeon,they encounter various enemies, bosses, and traps. The game was developed using kit-bashing techniques and also used community content. Lua scripting was used for programming all the Core games.</p> </p>
